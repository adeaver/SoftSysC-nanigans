## Learning About Memory and Vulnerabilities with Coroutines
Andrew Deaver, Kevin Zhang

#### Project Goals

Our goal for the project was to obtain a deeper understanding of memory management and control flow in C to implement coroutines. We planned to make our own simplified version of the coroutine mechanism to demonstrate what we had learned. It should be able to essentially jump between two different functions or “routines” for preemptive multitasking, each time saving its current state in a given function before jumping to the other one so that it can return to its “saved” point later to continue.

#### Learning Goals

For this project, our learning goals were to generally gain a better understanding for how memory is laid out in C. We originally wanted to use this understanding to be able to exploit memory vulnerabilities in C; however, in the end, we decided to use our powers for good and not evil by shifting our focus to learning how the way that C manages memory and control flow could be used to implement coroutines, which is basically a multitasking mechanism in C that utilizes in depth knowledge of memory in C to perform its function. Overall, with this project, we were seeking to become better C developers through achieving a better understanding of the low level mechanisms that C uses to handle control flow and memory management.

#### End Product

We made significant progress in working through exploit tutorials on Exploit Exercises, namely Protostar (linked above). Individually, we each completed all of the Stack and Format tutorials as well as some of the Heap tutorials, with periodic meetings to come together and discuss what we had learned. After also reading some papers discussing stack overflows, we started becoming familiar with memory layout and low-level C execution.
At some point in the middle of the Heap tutorials, we both came to the same conclusion that we were learning a great deal, but with the way we were headed there wasn’t really any sort of tangible deliverable or practical use for where our learning was taking us. Stack overflows and Heap overflows can teach one a lot about how memory works in C, but given their pervasive nature even the most basic programs come with a level of encryption and protection that exceeds the scope of this project. After some deliberation, we decided that it was better to pivot slightly to focus more on how memory worked in C code execution rather figuring out how to use this knowledge to exploit vulnerabilities. It was suggested to us that coroutines was a practical and helpful use of memory management in code execution. Therefore we channeled our efforts into learning more about coroutines and memory management in the stack/heap. After understanding how the multitasking process in coroutines functioned, we decided to try and implemented our own coroutine on a simplified scale.
We were able to successfully implement a coroutine. The basic structure of the program that we created looked like this:
![General Program Flow](../images/Structure.png?raw=True)

To accomplish this, we had to implement two functions that were inspired by the setjmp library in C. The first function was called setjmp. The point of setjmp is to read a the value for a buffer (while resetting it) and then capture the return address, so the program knows where to jump back to. In the C library, setjmp is architecture dependent and is actually implemented as a macro, not a function. Below is our implementation of setjmp (called setjmp_simple):

```
void __setjmp_simple(jump_buf_simple *buffer) {
	uint64_t sp;
	// It's 8(rbp) because we just allocated an 8 byte int
    asm("movq 8(%%rbp), %0"
			:"=r" (sp));
	buffer->sp = sp;
	//buffer->sp = __builtin_return_address(0); // Alternate solution
}
 
// We made our set_jmp functionality into a macro to better mimic the real mechanism
#define setjmp_simple(buffer, output) __setjmp_simple(buffer); output = buffer->data; buffer->data = 0;
```

You can see that the function __setjmp_simple takes in a buffer, which will be talked about later, and grabs the base pointer for the current function, which is known as rbp. We get the return address by moving 8 bytes up from the location of rbp because we just allocated an 8 byte integer.  This required us to use a bit of embedded assembly. The macro calls this function and assigns the current value of the buffer to an output variable and resets it. This is also how the setjmp macro works in the library.
The other part of our implementation required jumping back to this return pointer. This was actually fairly easy to do. In the code above, you can see that we assigned the pointer to a void function type inside of the buffer struct, which is shown below. This generates a warning because we’re manually setting the address of this function by assigning the integer value directly to the pointer. Once we do that, we can jump back to the return address by simply calling the function.

```
typedef struct {
	int data;
	void (*sp)(void);
} jump_buf_simple;
 
setjmp_simple(bufferA, val);
	if(!val) bufferB->sp();
```

Given the two halves of the code shown and the flow of execution chart above, put together into a comprehensive script called coroutines_simple.c results in the output below:

![Program Output](../images/Output.png?raw=True)

As you can see, our coroutines script can successfully jump between two different functions or “routines”, much like the originally created set_jmp and long_jmp can.
A really interesting problem that we encountered while working on this project was that we’d occasionally “lose” the return pointer. That is, sometimes we had complicated the stack so much that the compiler was unable to return to the correct location. For this reason, we often had to explicitly tell the compiler where to return. This resulted in a lot of code that looked like this:

```
void (*foo)(void) = __builtin_return_address(2);
foo();
```

![Stack](../images/Stackframe.png?raw=True)

#### Reflection

Because we pivoted on our project, we didn’t really end up between the upper and lower bounds identified in our original proposal. However, as per the bounds identified in our updated proposal, we ended up slightly above the lower bounds. We were able to implement setjmp and longjmp, which was our lower bound, but we also managed to integrate them into a demonstrable coroutine. We did not achieve any of our upper bound goals of being able to exploit our own version of setjmp and longjmp.
We both agree that we achieved our learning goals as evidence by a lot of the tricks we were able to pull in our implementation of coroutines. For example, understanding the lower level mechanics of C lead us to the thought process of assigning the pointer that we got from setjmp to a void function pointer to be able to call it again. Also, our understanding of return pointers helped in our final implementation when we needed to actually exit the program.
