## Exploiting C/Linux
Andrew Deaver, Kevin Zhang

### Goals

The goal of the project is to learn about various exploits in both C and linux in general. 
The lower bound of this project is to create an exploitable script with an explanation/demonstration of what makes it exploitable. 
A stretch goal for this project might be coordinating with the other exploit team to create scripts for each other and try to exploit their code/have them exploit our code or to find a bug in an already released software.

### Learning Goals

- Become better C developers
- Understand common pitfalls that developers make that cause security flaws
- Develop a better understanding of the low level mechanisms of C and Linux that cause these vulnerabilities

### Resources Needed

We've identified a few tutorials and exercises that we can start with to gain familiarity:
- Exploit Exercises, Nebula: https://exploit-exercises.com/nebula/
	- Solutions: https://leonjza.github.io/blog/2015/05/08/playing-exploit-exercises---nebula/
- Exploit Exercises, Protostar: https://exploit-exercises.com/protostar/ 
	- Solutions: https://thesprawl.org/research/exploit-exercises-protostar-stack/
	- This could help: http://liveoverflow.com/binary_hacking/
- Other Tutorials: https://github.com/FabioBaroni/awesome-exploit-development

We are open to more advanced resources as well.

### First Steps

1. Go through a tutorial on exploits
	- Each team member will individually do Protostar, after 2 weeks, we will come back together and discuss what we learned.
	- Definition of done: All modules of Protostar have been completed.
2. Develop simple program that demonstates buffer overflow
	- This will be done together in pair programming sessions.
	- Definition of done: We have successfully created an exploitable script and demonstrate that we can take advantage of the vulnerability.
3. Learn about a more advanced exploitation and develop an exploitable script using that (or those) exploitation(s).
	- This will most likely be done together in pair programming sessions.
	- Definition of done: We have successfully created an exploitable script and demonstrate that we can take advantage of the vulnerability.
